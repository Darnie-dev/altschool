    <h1>About Me - Ayobami</h1>

    <p>
      Hello, I'm Ayobami, and I'd like to share a bit about myself and why I
      chose to embark on a one-year BootCamp in cloud engineering at Altschool
      Africa. my name is Ayobami Oshokoya. a graduate of hydrology from the
      Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, born and raised in lagos.
      Growing up, i was one of those kids that loved to tear down things around
      the house and know what is making them function the way they do. i also
      was opportuned to have an early access to computers even though looking
      back now i could have done better than play Mavis Beacon and Microsoft
      Paint all day. my passion for technology and how things work is what has
      driven me to pursue a career in cloud engineering. Coupled with the fact
      that it is financially rewarding.
    </p>

    <h2>Why a One-Year BootCamp?</h2>
    <p>
      You might wonder why I chose a one-year BootCamp in cloud engineering when
      shorter, more condensed programs are available. The answer lies in the
      depth of knowledge I aim to attain and the time required to master a field
      as dynamic and extensive as cloud engineering. we know people love to
      refer to devops as the Jack of all Trades because you need to understand
      different technology tools to be a successful engr. A year-long program
      like Altschool Africs allows for comprehensive coverage of cloud
      technologies, ensuring that I not only grasp the basics but also delve
      deep into advanced topics. It provides the opportunity to engage in
      hands-on projects, build real-world applications, and address complex
      scenarios, all of which are essential for a profound understanding of
      cloud engineering. Additionally, the duration of the program facilitates
      gradual skill development. I believe that learning is most effective when
      it occurs in stages. A year-long commitment permits a natural progression
      from foundational concepts to advanced skills, thereby cultivating a
      robust skill set. I believe that by the time i would be graduating i would
      be a finished product through and through with a plethora of both soft and
      technical skills. Furthermore, the one-year time frame fosters networking
      and collaboration with peers and mentors. Building a supportive community
      of like-minded individuals is invaluable, and the extended duration of the
      program ensures these connections are nurtured over time.

    <h3>The Goal and Future:</h3>
    <p>
      My goal at the end of this program is to have gain solid theoretical
      knowledge as well as hands-on experience worthwhile to get an entry role
      in the field. In addition to it, I am looking to bag as much relevant
      certifications as I could before the end of the 12 months journey. The
      limitless potential of the cloud and the complexity of the field make this
      a compelling choice for my career path. With a one-year commitment, I am
      ready to immerse myself in the world of cloud engineering, gain a profound
      understanding of its intricacies, and become a part of the transformative
      force shaping our digital future. with How things are advancing, there is
      no way i am getting bored any time soon and i would advice anyone that is
      inquisitive and eager to learn to join this tech path.
